"I don’t know what I can do for you." Steve said.

"I don’t care, I didn’t mean to," he reassured her, "We’re already friends, we need to be friends, I know that."

"I’m not a doctor," said Draco, "I’ll get you what you need."

"Well, you’re not a doctor," Draco said."I mean, he’s a good man, he is," Harry said, "but there’s something about him that just makes you feel like you’re a burden."

"You forgive me for being so quick to believe that you did all this to her," he said, "but it’s fine when you have to keep her safe. She’s always safe, through you." She sighed, "I’m just glad you’re back." She looked at him, "I’ll see you soon."Harry shrugged.

"I’m so sorry, I really am."Ron nodded, and left them both standing in the common room. Harry felt a little bit better than he had done last year, and looked around for the other people in the castle. He found what he was looking for, and found his favorite spot to do it.The rest of the day was spent in the common room. Harry tried to ignore the grimness of the Slytherins, knowing that they were all in there. Hermione had told Hermione that she had a memory of one of the Gryffindors that had been the subject of the news at the end of the year, and Harry had told her about it when she had asked him to find her. She had said that she hoped that they would finally get a memory of a Weasley family that she could look forward to finding.The rest of the class returned to their usual levels of frustration. Harry had been assigned to Professor Balk, and he was being assigned to Slytherin, which was no different than the rest of the classes. He received a stern lecture about the importance of doing a proper homework assignment as usual and the need to get an essay out of the way so that he could focus on his work. He was barely keeping up with the excitement of the class and had to cancel to save his money on what he thought was a book he had to buy. Professor Balk was the only other person to leave, and Harry did not want to bother him. He was dismissed and marched out of the classroom. The rest of the students were still not satisfied with the assignments and the time it took for them to return to their dorms."Can I ask you a question," the Professor asked, "Or rather, ask me what set us apart from the rest?"

"I would like to hear it first," Harry said, "I mean, I think I’ll just have to ask a more specific question."The Slytherins continued to talk in silence. Professor McGonagall seemed to be going over the list of things they’d wanted to ask Harry, and Professor Balk was watching Harry’s progress in the classroom.In their fifth year, the Gryffindors were given a second task for the year, which was to superv the rebuilding of the castle. He could’ve easily become the head of the Ministry, or at least he wouldn’t have to worry about being elected Prime Minister.

"Good luck finding out about her, Potter."Harry laughed at that and went to his closet. He was still wearing his Quidditch robes, he had his wand and had a thick coat. He tried to feel better as he continued with his homework and whatever was not in his desk.The next day, Harry found that he couldn’t find his homework. He was standing in front of a desk and was leaning against it. Professor Balk had asked him to sit, but Harry didn’t want to go. Harry had a feeling that he couldn’t go, but it gave him pause as he realized he couldn’t."I’m sorry he said.
