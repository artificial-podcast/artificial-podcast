## Chapter 1

“See you tomorrow, Madame Pimps.”

“Bye, Miss Granger. You’re welcome.”

And suddenly a familiar hand was gripping her arse, pulling her closer. It was and old witch from school, 
the mysterious girl from accounting. “Oh, there you are. Are you all right? What have you done?”

## Chapter 2

Hermione slumped against the wall and looked around, trying to see how far away she was. Her eyes met the witch standing next to her, 
who nodded to the wall, leaving her to reconvene with her wand. “I’m fine. Just need to pee.”
Hermione found herself blushing.
“I’m honestly not sure.” Her companion didn’t reply.

“You’re welcome, Miss Granger.” Her hand tightened around Hermione’s breast, and she felt the moment she pulled away, 
feeling as if her whole world was spinning. “Come, take off your pants,” She commanded.

Hermione gasped, lifting alone and peering down.

“Now,” She said, eyes wide, “I’ll take these off and check your arse for any signs. I’ll get your underwear, and if you’re 
really a pu–” She was cut off as the witch pushed off the pants and proceeded to pull off the entire set.

Hermione blinked and turned her head.

“I’m going to see if you’re right.”

She swallowed lightly, eyes red at the same time.

“Are you alright?”

“What are you looking for?”

Hermione blinked.
