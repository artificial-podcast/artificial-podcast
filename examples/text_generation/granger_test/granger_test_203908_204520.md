So what was she doing working in a tea parlour?” Draco asked, somewhat exasperated at the thought. He couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable with the thought of not being able to explain the way she had worked in the past. When he couldn’t help but smile back at her, she seemed to have laid it all on the line. Draco grimaced as she took a seat beside him. He glanced up at her as she lifted a brow. “I don’t know,” he said, trying to slip a hand up her skirt. 

 

 The little girl slid her hand back up her skirt, rubbing at the hem as she reached over to pull him down. “Fucking hell, I’m not going anywhere.” He said slowly. 

 

 “I don’t know,” the little girl said, turning away from her sister. “I’m sorry. I’m not sure.” 

 

 mother, Helen, “How did you know she was going to be okay?” she asks. A sudden silence falls over the table as the mother and daughter join in the conversation. “You invited her to come to dinner with me, and I thought you might want to invite him to dinner with you.” Hermione flinches as though she ought to be surprised, staring at the wide-eyed witch for a moment. "I think you've learned something."Draco blinked and glanced up at the tall, slim figure sitting on the bed, his eyes wide. It looked a little too like he was merely laying on the floor, with his head resting on the pillow. His eyes were watering, and his countenance was slightly pale. He watched as the red-head spoke, his voice weary and calculating."Um," Hermione said, her voice a whisper. "What are you doing here?""I'm not going," Hermione said, her voice still low and low. "I'm in front of the door and I'm trying to sneak out the door. I'm going to the back of the house. I've got a map and I'm going to go inside. I'm going to come in and look for a place." She said, and then she followed him inside. He went in, saying that he'd have to get back to him.She did. She'd been in hurt love with him in the past. He was a perfect man. She'd never been a lover, and she hadn't known it. But he wasn't. She wasn't ready to let him go. She was ready to leave, and he'd had to go. She knew he would never make it. It was so hard to take her. She could feel her breathing tighten in her throat, and the panic that was being unleashed in her eyes. It was so hard to describe, but her brain was overloaded. This was being unleashed on her, as well as the rest of the twins who had been there. She couldn't think of anything else but to try it. She had to rise up and get out of the darkness.~"Darling, Daphne, this is very important. You need to go. I will do my best to save her and I will do everything I can. I will get out of this room before it is too late. Theo sighed, pulling Harry up in his arms. He had been anxious to get out of the library, but he had been too busy with work to even get out of the tent. He pulled Harry into the tent, preparing for the next day’s classes. He had been planning on going back to the house in the Forest of Dean when he had last tried to get out, but he had been too busy with work to even get out of the tent. He made his way back to the dorms, the kids and the child she was visiting. The healer was planning to bring some healing potions to be used when she would be home. She came back a little later than planned, and she was still talking in a rough voice. He was doing his best to calm her down, but the pain was threatening to take its toll. He looked over his shoulder at her, the pain being too much for him to bear. He knew that if she would not let him go, she knew she was in danger. He did not want her to leave him alone, to die alone. He would not go alone, he would go with the life he had been given. He had a power far beyond his ego. He could do nothing but defend her, he could do anything to protect her. 

 

 She said nothing and the world rose in her arms, the world around her. She was in danger, and he knew it. He knew she had died, but he felt like he needed to know more. He knew he had to find Harry Potter. He knew that if he could get back to Hogwarts, he would soon be an Auror. He was about to find that bastard. He was about to win. He had to find Harry Potter, and Harry Potter was going to be the last person he would ever be able to be trusted. 

 

 "You shall be doing everything in your power to defend yourself. There is no way you will be able to withstand a one-handed attack,” Harry said. His voice was low, his hands shaking at the grip he had on his jaw. 

 

 It was a surprise, but it wasn’t surprising. Harry had never been a loyal wizard, and he knew he had been since he was a child. He had felt the need to show his family him some love, but he had never been able to do that. He had the option to make the decision to have sex with her.What he said was the only thing that she wanted him to do was make the decision to have sex with her. It was a full-blown relationship. She was just a virgin and he wanted her to get into it with him. She wasn't ready for him to have sex with her anyway. He was too busy trying to make her feel it."You want sex with me?""I would, if you want to," she whispered. She was happy to have the chance to say that out loud, but not to upset him. "I know that I would never do that. I just know that I would. I just don't have the time."She wanted to admit that she had no intention of discussing it and to have her honest, honest answers. She truly knew that she wouldn't be able to have her broken heart, but it was still too late."I'm sorry," he said quietly. "I am sorry. I just can't bear to see you hurt, Hermione. I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't mean to hurt you."Hermione's body was shaking slowly, and she didn't know what to do. She'd never told a friend that she'd already hurt someone, or what she'd said to Harry when she'd asked him to help her. She couldn't take it anymore. 

 

 "You can't take it anymore," Hermione said, her voice shaking. "I've been trying to hide my feelings, but now..." she paused, she looked at Draco. "What?""I was trying to hide my feelings.""What?" Draco interrupted nervously. "And how?""I was trying to hide me from Draco," he said, his voice thick with emotion. "And then I wanted to show him what I really thought of me.""What?" Hermione asked, her voice breaking."You didn't tell me how to do it," Draco said, his voice loud and furious. "Why would anyone want to do this? I've thought it was a brilliant idea, I've thought about it for years, I've thought about it. When we have a few more hours, I'll be out of here."Hermione looked back at him, tears shooting down her cheeks, and she felt incredulous. The Dark Lord had been wrong all along, and Draco had been just as wrong. "You're not alone, Granger. I'm not alone," he said. "I've been fighting for five centuries and I can't see a way out of it. I don't want to leave this place. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to live."We were sitting in a quiet corner in the Great Hall, staring at the ceiling in an effort to quell the loudest voices. A small group of boys walked out of the Great Hall, grabbing the tables and chairs and sitting down to drink. She laid back on her blanket, clutching her coffee cup to her hand and pulling it out. She turned to find her husband, who was sitting at the table, his thick, dark hair more than a little messy, eyes bright and sad. "How did you get here?" she asked, putting the cup away and closing the cup. She could tell he was struggling with some inner turmoil, but he was still looking at the man. His face was strange and she recognized the look of disgust at his eyes. "I have to know." She said, her voice shaking, "Not to the man." 

 

 “Mione, come on, let’s go.” Hermione said to him, the feeling of her body against him as she ran back to the man. He followed her back to the man, looking for her. 

 

 “Well, it was a surprise. I hadn’t thought you would be there. You were there to be a role model for me when I needed it. I knew that. You were my version of the orphan. You were my most important role model for me. You were my hero and I was so proud of you. You were my second. 

 

 I wanted to be a hero, to be a hero, to be a hero. 

 

 But it was over. 

 

 I felt like I had no choice. I had no choice but to take you on 

 

 "It didn't work," Harry said, his eyes still on the door. "I'd been waiting until you'd heard I was arriving." 

 

 "You have to be kidding me," Hermione said, her voice low. "I can't believe you're pretending to be a spy. You'll never have the time for that." 

 

 "You'll never have the time for that, right?" Harry said, his voice low. "I'd used up the last of my money out of desperation. I'd had to use up all of it for a job I didn't want to do until I was paid by the next week at the bank." His voice trailed off. "I'd haven't had to go through all of the money I'd taken off my balance, but even then I'd wanted to have some money to pay back." He looked at Luna. "I'd fell in love with her, I'd need help. I'd had enough of the old man."She'd never let me down, really, she'd never let me down, but I need to be careful, she said. "I know you can't be here, but I'd like to be there."She hadn't said anything about why she wasn't here, but Draco Malfoy had gone to her and asked her questions she hadn't meant to ask. It was a shame she'd done it, but it did make her feel better. She had to try to be here She was young. She had a lot of family at all of them and she had to prove it once and for all. 

 

 The next day, she was locked in a room with a muggle man. He was dressed in a black outfit and had a large tattoo on his arm. His mouth was open and his eyes were wide. She could feel him asking questions but the way his body was looking was so different from his normal appearance. She was so sure that he had shown up for her that she only wondered whether she should be on the thrall.“You know I have to be honest with you,” she said once she had finished and pulled her wand in the bag, leaving her with the door open.She shut the door behind her, but it was still dark and everything in the house was silent, except for the muffled sound of someone’s voice and the muffled sound of being taken to the bedroom. She watched as a thin, shaggy black head covered her mouth, her fingers brushing with the tips of her fingers. "What is it?""A little girl. Not the most attractive girl to me, but she has the best hair in the world." She muttered, a little lower in her throat."I'm not bad at making things," Draco said, and when he finished he offered her a nod."Don't get me wrong, she is beautiful, but for her to be beautiful she has to be a good one. 

 

 “So you’re a good one?” she asks, her voice rising with curiosity. 

 

 “I am.” She nods, eyeing the man in a rather unsteady fashion. “Do you know how to spell it?” 

 

 “Well, I was wondering, anyway,” she smiles. “Do you know how to pronounce it?” She whispers, “What do you say to that?” 

 

 {oOo} 

 

 It had been a long time since he had spoken to her, but now she understood. He was calculating. He was calculating, knowing. He had hidden his thoughts, to protect them. He had made her feel safe, confident, and he had made her feel safe. She felt like she was the best thing in the world. She felt like she was the best thing. She felt like she was the best thing. It was a bad thing. 

 

 “Is that what you want?” he asked, and she appreciated that. 

 

 “I want to be the best person she has ever known.” She said and he felt as though his heart ached in his chest. 

 

 “You want to be the best person?” 

 

 “Yes.” She said with a smile and he felt his body shaking. 

 

 “Do you think you can see the scars?” he asked. 

 

 “I don’t,” Hermione said. “You can’t leave her alone. If she is hurt, she is going to be okay.” 

 

 “I can’t leave her alone?” he asked, looking worried. “She is hurting, and I have to put her back to rest.” 

 

 “You can’t go back there, Hermione.” I winced at the fact that my words were being used to make her back at me. 

 

 You two have no clue what you’re doing. 

 

 I don’t know what you’re doing, but you are not going to help her escape. 

 

 “Well, I would just like to let you know that it was not your intention to help her escape.” She said, turning to face me She had been waiting for help from the others before she had even finished my sentence. She had been waiting for me to tell her what I was about to do. I had promised to make her safe but she was going to make it so. I had promised to be there for her and be a part of her escape. I had promised that if she was really in danger I would help her escape. I had promised to wait until she was actually safe, but as I was going to make
