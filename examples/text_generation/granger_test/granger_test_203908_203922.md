Hermione stood in the middle of the street, her head resting on her heart. She had to be careful, and she couldn't help but worry for Hermione.The next thing she knew she was in front of a chain six feet long, and it was being pulled by an enormous white dragon. She was immediately dragged into the dragon's grasp. The dragon had stopped moving once Hermione was inside. She had no idea what she was doing, but she was sure she was doing something wrong. She knew it was a dragon, but it was a dragon with a magic that made her think it was a dragon. But she wasn't sure. The sun was burning brightly in her left hand. She didn’t have time to think anything else until she was back in the room, staring up at the ceiling. The other night, she had come back from the night on her feet and was in a bad mood. She was tired and she had to get up to go to bed. She hadn’t been sleeping well. The sun had risen and her hair was still stuck on the cold, damp floor. She knew she didn’t want to wake up like this and she wasn’t sure if she would ever wake. 

 

 

 The next morning, in the dining room, Hermione walked into the kitchen. She was greeted by a nice brunette, who greeted her courteously. She frowned to the side and asked, “What are you doing here?” She asked, trying to make her voice sound serious.“I’m going to make a few statues of some of the famous people from the past.” He said, moving towards her. “Go ahead, then! I’ll be back soon!” She said, saying goodbye to the twins and her friends. “You know, I’m scared of the dark and the dark arts. I really am. But I'm afraid of being alone. I want to show love to a man I love…" 

 

 Draco had been planning this for years and he had never stopped to think about it. But as he watched as the rest of the boys continued to ignore him, Draco was struck by something else, something that should have been obvious. 

 

 "What?" Harry was asking, and he was at that moment at the edge of the room. He was in his pyjama bottoms, staring at the ceiling. The room was dim, the lights dimming the room until it was somewhat dark. A soft moan escaped from the second mouth of her cunt, and the woman bent over her own legs to kiss them. She was moaning loudly as she sucked the tip of her finger into her mouth. She was breathing heavily, and there was a sudden rush to release her juices, but she was slowly closing her eyes and moving to the window. She closed hers, and squeezed her eyes shut to do so. She was gasping for breath, and wanted to do something else to help herself.“Oh, come on, Riddle!” She finished, wishing for him to start to walk slowly, but he wouldn’t. He wasn’t going to pull away from her, so she pushed against his arm. He didn’t look at her, and he didn’t move a muscle. He sucked in a deep breath, and started to lean forward. She could hear him breathing, and it was in the distance she'd heard him breathing. The other girl was already leaning back in the seat with her arms around him. He was not breathing."It's not your fault," she breathed, her voice so low it sounded like she hadn't even thought she was breathing. "You all made him breathe, and he's breathing again."He was breathing, and her arms were moving. The jagged rhythm of his breathing, the rhythm of how he was strong. He would have been safe if she hadn't attacked him or faced him.The moment she was exposed to his aura, he broke out and started walking towards her.“How are you?” he asked, watching her face as he ran.“I think I’ve gotten too intimate with you.” She said, moving towards him with her hand on his shoulder. She closed her eyes and tried to hold back the tears that were streaming down her cheeks. She lifted her hand and began gently shaking it, but it was too late. Her hands were trembling.She was too afraid to continue. The door to the room opened to reveal a large man in black clothes, but he was wearing a soft green robe. He looked a bit like a child, but he still had a smile on his face. The man put his hand on the door handle. "This is the man from this house, and you, too. You have to know that I am the one who has to die. You are not alone. I am here, and you are alive. If I really cared that much, you would be dead."““And what is this?” he asked.The queen made a face at him. “I did something to you. I do not want you to waste your life doing nothing. I have to die, and that is not what I am here for. I do not want you to lose your life. I do not want you to be in danger. I do not want you to lose your family. I do not want you to be in danger. I do not want you to be in danger. In the present situation, the only thing that can save you and your family is your life. You are not the only one who is ready to help. And once you have a chance to do so, I am ready. I will do everything in my power to help you. I will help you to get back to your best, and your best school. In this dark time. If you will not believe me, I am going to kill you. I will kill you. I will kill you. I will kill you. I will kill you. I will kill you. What do you think you're doing? Tell me, Lilith. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. I'm going to fucking kill you. I'm going to fucking kill you. I'm going to FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!! I'm going to fuck you! I'm going to fuck you! I'm going to fucking fucking FUCK you! FUCKING FUCK YOU! FUCKING FUCK YOU! FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING 

 

 “Fuck,” Harry whispered, “why do you and Neville keep talking about me,” Neville answered as the two men continued to kiss the ones on the bed. Snape’s fingers began to move up to the skin of his own neck, and the magic that was slowly becoming evident in his lower back started to play with his hair. He felt such relief as his fingers started to move up the wood of his neck. He felt like he had finally got to his feet. 

 

 “Mione?” Harry whispered into the back of his mind, his hand moving to hold back his tears. 

 

 “There’ a million reasons why she’s unloved. You don’t have to be the worst.” He snaps, disappearing the last of his tears onto the floor. “I know, I know,” Theo hollers, his hand slipping down his face. “She’s a freak. I think she likes him. She’s a bitch.” “She’s a freak.” Theo and Ron head is spinning.“Yes, she is.” The three look at each other in confusion. “How could she possibly be that naïve and selfish?” Ron’s mouth is caught between his hands and he looks to Theo, “She’s a fucking idiot.” He shifts his attention to Hermione, where the front door is locked and the back door is open.“She’s going to hide.” Hermione eyes are full of hope, “But I’m not sure if she’s going to make it to school without her. And I do think she’s going to be very heavy on potions.” She waves her wand, “I don’t know if I can cast potions, or even spellcraft the language properly, but I do know that I want her to do it. I want to see that she can do it her way I want her to be happy for me. So, what do you want me to do?""I want you to be happy for me," I said. "I want you to be happy for me."I put my arm around her and pulled my hand from her shoulders and wrapped it around my waist."Okay," I murmured."You want me to be happy for you?" she asked.I asked her and she nodded."I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I know you know me, and I want you to be happy for me. I want you to be happy for me. I know you know me too, and I want you to be happy for me. I know you know me, and I are happy for you. I know you know me, and we don't necessarily have to be married. I know you are my sister, and I would be proud to have you as my husband. I would appreciate your support." Ron said as he said this, and the door closed behind them, and the door opened and Ron smiled. He opened the door too, and the door was now a large one, and a large table set up. Ron sat down on the large table, peeking around, and he put his book back in his hands. He opened his eyes, and he saw the room was dark, and there was a light blue light in the corner."Are you okay?"Draco frowned."Say something, Draco," George said, and he put his wand on his waist."You think I'm going to murder my husband?" Draco said. "What? Why?""It's because I'm so angry with myself. The other day I was in the Great Hall with an older woman who was sitting in the Great Hall, watching the students who were going to be the first to be expelled."George said, and I heard the same thing. "George, please get your arse out of my head. You are essentially the enemy of the Muggle world, and in the name of Merlin and Dumbledore, you are." I said, looking at my watch. "Come on." I tried to finish, but he moved around me, ignoring me. "Fine." I said, pushing him away from me."I need to talk to you. We have to go now, so I will make it as quick as possible." He said, reaching for my wand. I pulled it from his hands, still trying to grab it, but Harry had pushed him away from me. 

 

 "Yeah, okay, alright." He said, stepping over the bed and walking to the corner of the room. "I'm going to bed, too. We can get out of here. I'll be back before noon, okay?" She asked, glancing at the clock in the room. 

 

 The next day, James sat with his head in his hands, watching the clock. He was just beginning to feel tired and tired, so he decided to tell her about the night before. She had told him something about how things had settled down earlier, but he had been too busy looking away. He had told him that he had been in the hospital all day and would be back in a few minutes. He had said nothing since, which was almost why he was in the hospital. He had lied about being in the hospital, but he had told her that he had been in the hospital all day and that he had been unable to get off of the bed. She had told him that he had been in the hospital all day and had been at the Hospital."I'm not saying that it wasn't a big deal, but it didn't change the fact that he had been in the hospital all day and had been at the Hospital for quite some time," Harry responded with a chuckle. "He was acting like he was at the Hospital when he called me."Hermione groaned, still trying to explain her feelings to him. "He is not a bad guy," she said with a smirk, "but I can't explain it to him."Draco looked at her with a stern look in his eyes. "I know, but I shouldn't be surprised if you're in Slytherin.""I know," Hermione said, "but I really do."Draco looked at her. "And I know that you're not the only one who's right.""I think we need to get a bit of practice and make sure that you don't become too well-versed enough to read."The next words were more appropriate; "Oh, yes, that is true. I'm sorry, but I have a feeling you're going to be the way you are."And I was talking, trying my best. "Do you think you're going to be a successful Magic student?" I asked him, trying my best to be a good Magic student. "I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think it's a good idea to tell me that I'm going to be a good Magic student." Hermione smiled. "You're a good student."Another smile tugged at her lips. "You're not a bad student, Hermione. It's just that you're the one who makes me mad though." Hermione pursed her lips."Yes?" Hermione asked, confused. She hadn't even been a student. "What is it to you?""Me?" Hermione asked, her eyes watering."You told me last year that you'd be a good student. You're not a bad student -
