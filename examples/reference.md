# A demonstration of how format text correctly

++
This document and audio file created from the document, gives examples of how to correctly format text and dialogs.

## This is a set of dialog lines:

Example:

“See you tomorrow Madame Pimps.”

“Bye Miss Granger, you’re welcome.”

“Oh, there you are, are you all right? What have you done?”

## The next paragraph is read in a narrator's voice:

++
To use a narrator's voice for the following paragraph, add a line that contains only two plus-signs just before the paragraph. The paragraph ends with the first blank line. 

Example:

++
And suddenly a familiar hand was gripping her arse, pulling her closer. It was a witch from school, the mysterious girl from accounting.

“Oh, there you are, are you all right? What have you done?”

## How to space sentences

++
To correctly narrate sentences spoken by the same person, surround each sentence with quotationmarks, separated by a comma, period or dash. Or, have each sentence on a new line, without a blank line in-between.

Example:

“I’m fine. I just need to pee - I will be ready in a minute!”

“I’m fine.", "I just need to pee” - "I will be ready in a minute!"

“I’m fine."
"I just need to pee.”
"I will be ready in a minute!"

++
If multiple sentences are spoken by the same person in quick succession, avoid periods and just use commas, exclamation- or question marks.

Example:

“Oh, there you are, are you all right? What have you done? This is insane!”

## Enforce a paragraph

++
Text is narrated differently depending on how is formatted. A mixed set of sentences and dialogs can be written as one continious paragraph, without new lines breaking the flow of the text. To make sure this is still correctly interpreted as a paragraph and not just a string of sentences, add a line that only contains two @-signs just before the paragraph. The paragraph ends with the first blank line. The following two examples demonstrate the difference.

Example without enforcing a paragraph:

“Now”, She said, eyes wide, “I’ll take these off and check your arse for any signs.". "I’ll get your underwear, and if you’re  really a pus–...”. She was cut off as the witch pushed off the pants and proceeded to pull off the entire set.

Now as a paragraph:

@@
“Now”, She said, eyes wide, “I’ll take these off and check your arse for any signs.". "I’ll get your underwear, and if you’re  really a pus–...”. She was cut off as the witch pushed off the pants and proceeded to pull off the entire set.
